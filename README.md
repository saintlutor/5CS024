repo of our collaborative development module - based of a health care web application

for the images to be available, it seems im not sure if making a branch act as a folder called images will work. As i cannot make a folder in a github repo, i assume a folder equivilant is a branch, if this does not work
i would suggest you download the files locally and make a folder called images where you place all the image inside , this should fix any image visibilty / broken image problems. This occurs as the code for the images is 
to suit cases in such format : "images/image.jpg".
